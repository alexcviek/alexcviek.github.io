      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have always loved to learn languages and solve puzzles. This lead first to my graduation from Oriental Studies at Uni, second, combined with fascination about technology and science, to become a Web Developer. After all, JavaScript is just another language for me, like Russian or Norwegian, with that difference, that now it enables me to do the job I love!</p>
